Step by step example:
-- mode /gm:
<(\w+)>([^<]+)<\/\1>		-> "\1" : "\2"
(?<=[^">])$\r\n				-> (removes end of lines inside quotes)
"$\r\n						-> `", `
<catalog>					-> { "catalog" : [ (could just as easily type this replacement)
</catalog>					-> ] } (same with this replacement)
<book id="([\w\d]+)">		-> { "book" : { "id" : "\1",
,\s+</book>					-> } },
\s{2,}						-> ()
\}, ]						-> }  ]

All in one example:

... Yer kidding me, right?

# RegexSimplified
Doing complicated regex work with multiple simple regex matches

Example files end in name.example.txt
Matching regex patterns (complicated and simple) are contained in name.regex.txt

Regexes are shown as:
Regex	->	replacement
Note that any replacement surrounded by () is blank, and if there is text in the replacement it is explanatory.  ([\w\s]*) is an invalid replacement anyway.
In some cases, the grave accent will be used to surround regexes or replacements which start or end with spaces
